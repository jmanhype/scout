# Production Rollout Plan - Scout Multivariate TPE

## Overview
Rollout plan for deploying multivariate TPE support to Scout production environment.

## Current Status
- âœ… Implementation complete
- âœ… Testing validated (50+ runs)
- âœ… Documentation ready
- ðŸ”„ Ready for production deployment

## Rollout Strategy

### Week 1: Preparation
- [ ] Code review by team
- [ ] Update CI/CD pipelines
- [ ] Prepare feature flags
- [ ] Create rollback plan

### Week 2: Alpha Testing
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment
- [ ] Run parallel comparison tests
- [ ] Monitor performance metrics
- [ ] Collect early feedback

### Week 3: Beta Release
- [ ] Enable for 10% of new studies
- [ ] Monitor error rates
- [ ] Track performance improvements
- [ ] Update documentation site

### Week 4: General Availability
- [ ] Enable by default for all new studies
- [ ] Maintain univariate fallback
- [ ] Publish announcement
- [ ] Update marketing materials

## Configuration Management

### Feature Flags
```elixir
config :scout, :features,
  multivariate_tpe: System.get_env("SCOUT_MULTIVARIATE_TPE", "true") == "true"
```

### Study Configuration
```elixir
# Opt-in to multivariate
%{
  sampler: Scout.Sampler.TPE,
  sampler_opts: %{
    multivariate: true  # Explicit opt-in
  }
}

# Opt-out if needed
%{
  sampler: Scout.Sampler.TPE,
  sampler_opts: %{
    multivariate: false  # Force univariate
  }
}
```

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Studies
No action required - existing studies continue with their current configuration.

### For New Studies
Multivariate TPE enabled by default after GA.

### For Power Users
```elixir
# Advanced configuration
Scout.Study.new(
  sampler: Scout.Sampler.TPEEnhanced,
  sampler_opts: %{
    multivariate: true,
    gamma: 0.25,           # Good/bad split
    n_candidates: 24,      # Candidates per iteration
    bandwidth_factor: 1.06 # Scott's rule
  }
)
```

## Monitoring Plan

### Key Metrics
1. **Performance Metrics**
   - Average optimization score improvement
   - Time to convergence
   - Sample efficiency

2. **System Metrics**
   - Memory usage
   - CPU utilization
   - Response times

3. **Business Metrics**
   - User adoption rate
   - Study success rate
   - User satisfaction scores

### Dashboards
```yaml
grafana_dashboards:
  - name: scout_multivariate_tpe
    panels:
      - optimization_performance
      - correlation_detection_rate
      - convergence_speed
      - error_rates
```

## Rollback Plan

### Triggers
- Error rate > 1%
- Performance degradation > 20%
- Critical bug discovered

### Procedure
1. Disable feature flag immediately
2. Route all traffic to univariate TPE
3. Investigate and fix issues
4. Re-test before re-enabling

### Commands
```bash
# Disable multivariate TPE globally
export SCOUT_MULTIVARIATE_TPE=false
mix phx.server

# Or via runtime configuration
Scout.Config.set(:multivariate_tpe, false)
```

## Communication Plan

### Internal
- Engineering: Technical documentation and training
- Support: FAQ and troubleshooting guide
- Sales: Feature benefits and talking points

### External
- Blog post: "Scout Achieves Optuna Parity with Multivariate TPE"
- Documentation: Updated with examples and best practices
- Changelog: Detailed release notes

## Success Criteria

### Technical
- [ ] < 0.1% error rate
- [ ] < 10% memory increase
- [ ] > 50% performance improvement on correlated problems

### Business
- [ ] > 80% adoption rate for new studies
- [ ] > 90% user satisfaction
- [ ] Positive user feedback

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- Performance overhead (mitigated by benchmarking)
- Memory usage (mitigated by monitoring)

### Medium Risk
- Compatibility issues (mitigated by gradual rollout)
- User confusion (mitigated by documentation)

### Mitigation
- Comprehensive testing completed
- Rollback plan in place
- Feature flags for control

## Timeline

| Week | Phase | Actions | Success Criteria |
|------|-------|---------|------------------|
| 1 | Prep | Review, setup | Ready for deploy |
| 2 | Alpha | Staging deploy | No critical issues |
| 3 | Beta | 10% rollout | < 0.1% errors |
| 4 | GA | 100% rollout | All metrics green |
